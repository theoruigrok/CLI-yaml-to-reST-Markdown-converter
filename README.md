# CLI YAML to reST/Markdown Converter

I made this project to gain some experience with object-oriented programming in python, as previously all my oop experience has been with C#, using some libraries to construct the Command Line Tool and learning about yaml, markdown and rest file formats.
If I would do this project again, I would use existing libraries instead, but it was useful to learn the structure of these document formats.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theoruigrok/CLI-yaml-to-reST-Markdown-converter.git
   cd CLI-yaml-to-reST-Markdown-converter


## Usage

python main.py <input_file.yaml> -rest -markdown -both

An example yaml input file is included.
